# My Meme Gallery

Create a gallery of memes using Next.js that fetches posts from reddit.com/r/memes. The gallery allows users to scroll infinitely, fetching more entries as they scroll down. Clicking on a thumbnail in the gallery displays the image in its full resolution using the Photoswipe library.
